            Introduction
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you drive a goods vehicle which is more than 3.5 tonnes in weight and it is used to carry goods as part of a trade or business, by law you need to have a goods vehicle operator's licence.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a service, the Vehicle Operator Licence (VOL) application is what users have to go through in order to obtain an operating licence. They have to provide financial evidence, director information, and much more, they even have to post an advert in a local newspaper to advertise their operating centre (this is part of legislation, so is a real sticking point for the service). This case study is focussed on the work I was involved in on improving the quality of Vehicle Operator Licence (VOL) applications at the point of submission, to reduce demand on caseworkers reviewing the application and to reduce the timescale in which users get granted an operator licence.
          </p>

              <figcaption>Service blueprint of the initial stages on the apply for a vehicle operator licence service</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h3>The situation</h3>

          <p>
            To gain an understanding on the quality of the applications being submitted, myself and the user researcher on the project analysed a random sample of 362 new applications from a set of all new applications received between April-Dec 2019. We estimated that only 5% of applications are complete at the point of submission. The rest require caseworker investigation. As you can imagine, this raised a few eyebrows when we crunched the numbers, but raised the question, what can we do to make this service better for our users?
          </p>

          <h3>The task</h3>

          <p>
            My role in the project was to work closely with the user researcher, content designers, developers and stakeholders to think of ways to improve the service that would meet the business needs of reducing caseworker demand and improving user satisfaction. I was responsible for facilitating workshops, designing and prototyping possible solutions to this problem.
          </p>

          <h4>Reviewing the data on application submissions</h4>

          <p>
            Initially, I worked closely with the user researcher on the project to understand what the users were having problems with in the application that caseworkers had to reach out to get more information on.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_rft/research1.png" alt="Analysis of new applications, type of omissions and errors." width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>Analysis of new applications, type of omissions and errors.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            From looking at the data, we noticed that providing evidence of an advert and financial information were not performing well at all! To add to this, we also reviewed the counts of errors users were having per application.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_rft/research2.png" alt="Analysis of new applications, count of errors per application." width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>Analysis of new applications, count of errors per application.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            This was a real indicator to us that allowing users to skip the process was a problem, and that we were not providing users with enough information prior to them submitting their applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            When cross referencing this with the caseworkers who were dealing with the applications and the service blueprint, we realised that there was a massive demand for educating the users in the application process, as case workers noted that applicants were learning after they had submitted their applications, not before.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went away with this research and started to think of solutions for the end-to-end journey.
          </p>

          <h3>Defining the problem</h3>

          <p>
            To get the conversation started on ideas, I organised a brainstorming session for the team to help spark ideas after going through the service blueprint, the pain points, the application research and caseworker feedback. I also created a ‘how might we’ statement to help encourage the conversation.
          </p>

          <h4>How might we statement</h4>

          <p>
            How might we reduce the number of submitted applications which require additional caseworker input so that:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>casework load is reduced</li>
            <li>operators get licences within the SLA timescale (av. 40 days)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>

              <figcaption>An example of our brainstorming and voting session to help encourage ideas in the team and prioritise them</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            We concluded 4 main areas to focus on, which were:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>To introduce more guidance throughout the application process and links to further reading</li>
            <li>To explore creating a tool, or a way users can check if they’re ready to apply for an operator licence</li>
            <li>To explore an alternative, or ways to improve providing advert evidence in the application, as this was the main problem! </li>
            <li>To explore how we could educate users on the financial information they need to provide</li>
          </ul>

            </figure>
          </div>

          <h3>On page guidance</h3>

          <p>
            Working closely with the user researcher, I identified 5 key areas in the application process that we thought would help educate users and improve the quality of applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            After reviewing the designs with stakeholders, I prototyped the solutions so that we could take them into user testing. We organised and shadowed current users of the service testing these new page designs to understand their thoughts on the suggested improvements, with the majority of sessions being positive.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_rft/focus.png" alt="The 5 key areas on the application journey that were proposed" width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>The 5 key areas on the application journey that were proposed</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            One great bit of feedback from the research was:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>​​"This is superior to the functionality that is already in place. This will be easy for new people/admin people to use. I can imagine being able to tell someone over the phone how to use it."</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            These have since been implemented on the live service, and have had a positive impact on informing users of what is required.
          </p>

          <h3>Creating a tool so users can check if they’re ready to apply</h3>

          <p>
            This was by far the most challenging concept, but also the one I felt would have the biggest impact on the users. Having a tool available online that a user could use to understand if they’re ready to apply  with information on where they need to improve would be incredibly useful!
          </p>

          <p>
            The first step I took was to analyse the current application process, and use this alongside the notable issues users faced to understand what this checker tool should include and how it could work.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">

              <figcaption>Analysing the current application, what is asked in the application, and how we could structure this in an online tool.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h4>User journey map</h4>

          <p>
            From here, I worked on putting together a user journey map of the potential tool, that could determine the vehicle type, the licence type and if the user is ready to apply. The idea was that the tool would analyse their answers, and give them a results page to guide them on where they needed more information.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_rft/userjourneymap.png" alt="A user journey map, showing the 3 key stages in the proposed checker tool." width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>A user journey map, showing the 3 key stages in the proposed checker tool.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            After reviewing this with the team and stakeholders, we tweaked the journey map, and started considering the design.
          </p>

          <p>
            We knew we wanted to keep it simple, and took inspiration from the Brexit checker tool, which was a series of single page questions that gave the user a final page with guidance based on their answers.
          </p>

          <h4>Designing, building and testing the prototype</h4>

          <p>
            Once we were happy with the journey, I went away and built a prototype we could test with current users of the Vehicle Operator licence service. This resulted in several iterations of the checker, with lots of a/b testing of multiple results pages. The most notable finding being that users preferred a much more simple, direct ‘results page’ that gave them links to where they could go for further reading, rather than including it all in the page.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_rft/prototype.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the documentation of the user journey map, prototype user journey, A/B testing and the user research conducted on the tool." width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>A screenshot of the documentation of the user journey map, prototype user journey, A/B testing and the user research conducted on the tool.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            After an extensive round of user testing and refinement on the tool, plans were ceased to build the tool because of commitments in the team elsewhere. With this in mind, we explored what a minimal viable product (MVP) could look like for this tool that we could develop, launch and monitor whilst there wasn’t capacity in the team to build the tool. This would allow us to test our hypothesis without putting too much strain on the development team.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Exploring an MVP of the checker tool
          </h4>

          <p>
            To start this new approach of a minimum viable product, I organised a team workshop to explore ideas with the team.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_rft/mvp_session.jpg" alt="A picture of the workshop that took place, discussing the ideas for an MVP" width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>A picture of the workshop that took place, discussing the ideas for an MVP</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            We decided as a team to pursue adding a single page that would be positioned at the start of the application journey, that would inform users of the most popular problems that were found in research. After several rounds of iterations between the team and stakeholders of the prototype, the page is now being <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-vehicle-operator-licence">tested and monitored after users continue from the start page on the Vehicle operator licence service</a>.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">

            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            The interactions on the page, and its impact on the quality of applications is being watched closely, to inform the next steps with how we shape this MVP!
          </p>

          <h3>
            Exploring alternatives to the advert problem
          </h3>

          <p>
            Due to the advert being part of legislation, and therefore very difficult to change, ideas are currently being explored but is in the very early stages of discovery!
          </p>

          <h3>
            Conclusion
          </h3>

          <p>
            The ‘right first time’ project is still ongoing due to it trying to tackle one of the biggest problems on the whole service, the quality of applications at the point of submission. However, some of the current implementations have had a great impact so far, with others currently being monitored to understand how we can improve users' understanding further of the details needed on an application. The intention for this project is to constantly keep learning and understanding how best we can support our users before and during their applications to improve the quality of the service and therefore fulfill the business goal of reducing caseworker demand, watch this space!
