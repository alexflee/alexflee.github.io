            Introduction
          </h3>

          <p>
            This case study focusses on designing a new service for light goods vehicle (LGV) operators who were affected by changes to the operator licensing regime within the UK because of the UK-EU negotiations.
          </p>

              <figcaption>A picture of the full temporary transport manager service blueprint</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h3>The situation</h3>

          <p>
            Due to the UK-EU negotiations, vehicles such as vans used by couriers and delivery services internationally (including to the Republic of Ireland) were brought into the scope of operator licensing. This meant that people using light goods vehicles only who were out of scope because the UK was part of the EU would now need to do a lot more to operate internationally!
          </p>

          <p>
            Initially, guidance was provided on GOV.UK to enable critical workers to book a test by contacting a DVSA email. However, due to a high demand of emails being received (c40k) that were being manually processed, it was decided an alternative had to be created!
          </p>

          <p class="inset">
            Transport managers are responsible for directing, coordinating, planning and overseeing tasks and operations within an organisation involving transportation activities. They are required to ensure the legal requirements for road haulage are met.
          </p>

          <p>
            The VOL service team was put forward to help design and build this new service and make changes to the VOL service.
          </p>

          <h3>The task</h3>

          <p>
            As the primary service designer in the Vehicle Operator Licensing (VOL), I was in initial conversations with senior stakeholders at the Department for Transport (DFT) to help design a new service for LGV operators. LGV operators with good repute could use this service to apply to become temporary transport managers.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was responsible for envisaging how the service could work and be as simple as possible for users, as well as leading on the design strategy of the service and it’s relationship with the current VOL service. I was also responsible for facilitating workshops and design reviews with key stakeholders from the Office of the Traffic Commissioner (OTC), Department for Transport (DFT) and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA).
          </p>

          <h3>Discovery phase</h3>

          <p>
            There were two key things to focus on in the discovery phase. The first step was to gather as much research as possible we had on this new user group of light goods vehicle drivers. The second was to talk to all interested stakeholders across the OTC, DFT and DVSA on the requirements for the service.
          </p>

          <h4>Gathering research</h4>

          <p>
            Research was probably one of the most difficult parts of this project, due to the design team having very limited knowledge of this new user group who were essentially being given a lot more hoops to jump through because of negotiations out of their control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to working with a great user researcher, the team had a very good idea of current VOL licence users, who were already operating with light goods vehicles as well as heavy goods vehicles. We used the most important aspects of this research, such as what current users struggled with in the VOL application process, to guide our design decisions on this new service.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, we requested at a minimum to at least get permission to test our future prototype with potential uses of this new service from DFT.
          </p>

          <h4>Working with stakeholders</h4>

          <p>
            The second step in the discovery phase was to establish from stakeholders what information they required from users in order to process and review an application. It was also a key opportunity to allow us to ‘zoom out’ and establish the end to end journey, such as how users would get to this service, who was responsible for what, and how the applications would be processed.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_ar/team_discussion.png"  alt="An initial online workshop with stakeholders to capture ideas, concerns, risks, what information we should ask for in the new service, a potential user journey and how it could integrate into the VOL service." width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>An initial online workshop with stakeholders to capture ideas, concerns, risks, what information we should ask for in the new service, a potential user journey and how it could integrate into the VOL service.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            I faciliated multiple sessions with stakeholders to compile a list of all necessary information they would need from users. These sessions also enabled us to discuss:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Information stakeholders wanted from users</li>
            <li>Needs of the users going through the application</li>
            <li>How these applications would be reviewed and by who</li>
            <li>What the options were for users with a refused application, such as hiring a transport manager or submitting an appeal against a refused application</li>
            <li>How to proceed with an approved application</li>
            <li>How an approved application could be used in the Vehicle Operator licence application process</li>
            <li>The end to end user journey, and what each organisation would be responsible for in this journey.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Once we were clear on the end to end journey, I created a user journey map that highlighted all possible outcomes and how the information would be shared between organisations.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>

              <figcaption>A user journey map including the front and back end processing of the service, along with organisational handovers.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h3>Designing the service</h3>

          <p>
            The first thing I wanted to establish in the design was the priority that questions should be asked in. After multiple stakeholder discussions, it was agreed to only allow operators of good repute through because of road safety concerns.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was became a notable risk for the design team, due to the likelihood that alot of users would not have the experience to apply, however, it definitely confirmed the priority should be finding out if the user had the required credentials before continuing to ensure we did not waste their time. It also emphasised we should also focus on making sure our ‘unhappy paths’ in the journey were clear and informative for users who did not have enough experience.
          </p>

          <h4>Creating a service blueprint</h4>

          <p>
            Once all stakeholders were happy with the steps, I created a service blueprint to reflect what we had agreed.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">
            <figure>
              <img src="../library/images/work_ar/blueprint.jpg"  alt="My initial blueprint of the service, including the build up to using the service, the service itself and the application processing from the user and caseworkers point of view." width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>My initial blueprint of the service, including the build up to using the service, the service itself and the application processing from the user and caseworkers point of view.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>
            The blueprint included:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>How users would find out about the service</li>
            <li>Initial steps the user could take before applying</li>
            <li>Creating an application</li>
            <li>The application verdict process from a users point of view</li>
            <li>How to review an application fom a caseworkers point of view</li>
            <li>The appeals process</li>
            <li>Using the application reference code in the VOL licence application</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            After multiple iterations, we had established our journey!
          </p>

          <h4>Creating an initial prototype</h4>

          <p>
            I took this blueprint away to create an initial design of the service using the GDS prototype kit. I worked closely with a content designer to create our journey, and established the key phases in our journey, these were:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Find out if the user is using the right vehicle</li>
            <li>Find out if the user has the right experience</li>
            <li>Show the unhappy paths if 1 and 2 are not met</li>
            <li>If correct vehicle and experience, ask for users personal details</li>
            <li>Ask for users contact details</li>
            <li>Ask the user to record their work history for the last 10 years</li>
            <li>Ask the user to sign a declaration</li>
            <li>Show the user a confirmation page with a unique reference number and next steps</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            We created a design based on all the components and patterns in the GDS Design System to ensure we were creating a simple and easy to use service. It also gave us a good foundation for accessibility using well tested components.
          </p>

          <div class="picture">

              <img src="../library/images/work_ar/start.png"  alt="An early screenshot from one of the initial user journey maps" width="100%"/>
              <figcaption>An early screenshot from one of the initial user journey maps</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <h4>Integrating a work history pattern from DFE</h4>

          <p>
            As we had limited research on this user group, I started gathering research on similar services from across the public sector. This led to conversations with designers at the Department for Education to learn how they designed the teaching training service. This service used the ‘record history’ design component, which helped its users record their teacher training.
          </p>

          <p>
            I put this research into practice by using the ‘record history’ component from DFE in our new service when asking users to enter their work history. This ensured we were using a well-researched component in our service as it was used across many services at DFE.
          </p>

          <p>
            One key aspect of the ‘record history’ component was using an alert feature to show users if they had gaps in their work history. This was crucial for our processing, as applications with work history gaps that were not accounted for (users could add absences) would most likely result in a declined application. This component was a real life saver for designing the prototype!
          </p>

              <img src="../library/images/work_ar/work.png"  alt="Using the ‘record history’ component from DFE in our prototype to allow users to add their work history, and alert them with any gaps." width="100%"/>

          </div>

          <h4>
            Creating a design for the internal system
          </h4>

          <p>
            We also had to design an internal system for processing these applications. I took part in creating these designs based on the internal system that VOL used to process Vehicle Operator licence applications. The main reason for emulating this design was due to VOL caseworkers inheriting the responsibility to process these applications, therefore, creating a similar system they were used to was a key focus.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Authorising the application in VOL
          </h4>

          <p>
            I was also part of the agile delivery team responsible for updating VOL to accommodate the new light goods vehicle type, and designing the process for how successful temporary transport manager applications could add their unique reference code when applying for a licence.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to reduce the strain on the development team, we decided to go for an MVP approach by adding some additional functionality to the current adding a transport manager journey. We decided to now offer users a choice, when applying for a light goods vehicle licence, on what qualification they had. The two options were an approved application via the temporary transport manager service, or the usual transport manager CPC qualification.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Developing and researching the service with users
          </h3>

          <p>
            After multiple iterations of the prototype and an alpha assessment, we managed to get contact details for some potential users who were willing to test the prototype. This led to some really interesting insights, such as the need to update a lot of the content due to feedback of some phrasing being confusing.
          </p>

          <p>
            This also highlighted that our ‘unhappy paths’ needed a lot more information to guide users on the next steps if they did not meet the standard.

            Unhappy paths
          </h4>

          <p>
            After feedback from users, I spent a lot of time with the DVSA content design team to discuss updating our guidance on GOV.UK on transport managers. We submitted a request with GDS to update our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/become-transport-manager">transport manager guidance (link opens in a new tab)</a>, which resulted in a complete overhaul of the guidance we provided users. This enabled us to link to this guidance from within the service to help users who needed additional help.

          <h4>
            Refining the prototype and mapping the full service
          </h4>

          <p>
            After lots of refinement and research, we had a prototype we were happy with on both the service and internal system! I mapped out a full service blueprint of the end to end journey, including the screenflows to share with stakeholders so everyone was clear on the bigger picture. This included the front-end journey, the back-end caseworker journey, and appeals process.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Launching the service
          </h4>

          <p>
            After tweaking the prototype with some additional Javascript to create a hi-fidelity journey, we passed our Beta assessment, and have since launched the service. This was a very interesting challenge with multiple stakeholder groups, but approaching the problem with a design thinking methodology, and bringing stakeholders on the design journey was a great way to build a service we were all happy with!
          </p>

          <p>
            As a team we are monitoring the the service to understand any improvements that made need to be implemented going forward.
