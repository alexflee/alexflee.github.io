          Using ChatGPT as an interaction designer

          An honest reflection of how I've been using ChatGPT in my day to day to speed things up and learn new things

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Now that the dust has settled with ChatGPT, and the relentless advice has calmed down on social media, I thought I would give an honest take on how I’ve been using ChatGPT as an interaction designer.</p>
      <p>I'm writing this because I'm curious about how others may be using it. For me, two categories have naturally appeared when I’ve been using ChatGPT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>using it to speed up what I’m doing</li>
        <li>exploring how I could use it to improve my ways of working and learn new things</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this blog post, I’m going to talk through what things I’ve been doing within these two categories, starting with how I’ve been using it to speed things up for myself.</p>
      <h3>Speeding things up</h3>
      <p>There are three things that stick out for me for how I've been using it to speed things up.</p>
      <h4>Summarising or noticing things</h4>
      <p>It's good at summarising things. I've been using it numerous times to consolidate information such as statistics or content when it is safe to do so. I often use it to summarise my own messages to colleagues to ensure I’m not wasting anyone's time. </p>
      <p>It's also useful for finding consistencies or patterns in things that take time to digest.</p>
      <p>I’ve used it to help me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>summarise my own messages to others when I’m sharing a big piece of work</li>
        <li>notice patterns in data or snippets of content that would otherwise take time to digest</li>
        <li>convert word documents of content into HTML pages with the correct typography markup from the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GDS design system (link opens in new tab)</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Using it as a soundboard for getting ideas or inspiration</h4>
      <p>Now and again, I’ve found ChatGPT to be quite a good soundboard. It can be useful for generating a new way to phrase something or offer an alternative to a problem.</p>
      <p class="inset">Disclaimer, I don’t think it’s in any way a replacement for writing content, but it can often offer a different take on something that sparks conversation or is at least amusing to consider.</p>
      <p>More than once it’s offered me and others something that keeps the momentum going on how to phrase something in guidance or email content.</p>
      <h4>Manual intervention</h4>
      <p>I've used ChatGPT the most when needing some help with a laborious task. In the absence of something like the <a href="https://fakerjs.dev/">npm package faker (link opens in a new tab)</a> to generate dummy info, It’s a godsend for making code changes when shortcuts aren’t enough to capture code everywhere. So far, I’ve used it to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>update Json files used in prototypes in several places when things like faker can’t help</li>
        <li>generate paragraphs of text as a persona for a more realistic prototype</li>
        <li>scan a HTML file and make several changes on my behalf</li>
        <li>clean up my prototype files when necessary</li>
        <li>explain code changes in prototypes or user journey maps when sharing work</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Improving my ways of working and learning new things</h3>
      <p>Probably where it has impressed me the most is just how powerful it is as a learning tool or being helpful when looking for answers from coding problems to holiday trip advice (it’s great for this by the way).</p>
      <h4>Prompts aren't everything</h4>
      <p>I’ve seen a lot of advice out there for getting the ‘perfect prompts’ but I’m in favour of starting from scratch if you’re looking to learn something. For me personally I learn best when I'm getting the hang of something slowly to progressively build up my knowledge and ChatGPT is amazing for this. It’s been a great help for building my knowledge on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>learning more in nunjucks, a popular language for building with the GDS prototype kit</li>
        <li>why my code isn’t working</li>
        <li>explaining what my code problem is, if I can’t seem to figure it out</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rumour has it Stackoverflow are building an AI tool but until then, I can safely say I’ve replaced that as the go to place for answers for the time being.</p>
      <h4>Learning new things on the fringes of my knowledge</h4>
      <p>Initially I was throwing in a tonne of questions into ChatGPT just to see what it could do. This began as a purely experimental thing like most I imagine, but I soon realised just how useful it could be. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole trying to think of ideas of how it could speed up my ways of working, and stumbled across some interesting stuff I would have never come across before.</p>
      <h4>Creating a user journey map script from scratch</h4>
      <p>One idea I explored was if ChatGPT could help me build a script to record the pages on my prototype and create a user journey map. After an initial question of:
      <p class="inset">"can you help me record the pages in my prototype and download screenshots of the pages?"</p> 
      <p>I was soon exposed to languages and packages I had never used before, and slowly but surely, we worked together to build a working version of my initial idea using python and selenium to initially:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>start at a given URL</li>
        <li>navigate to several pages in order</li>
        <li>highlight what link was selected on each page</li>
      </ul>
       <div class="picture">
          <figure>
            <img src="../../../images/article_chatgpt/highlighting_links.png" alt="A screenshot of a prototype question page that is generated after automatically selecting an option and highlighting what link or button was selected." width="100%">
            <figcaption>A screenshot of a prototype question page that is generated after automatically selecting an option and highlighting what link or button was selected.</figcaption>
          </figure>
      </div>
      <p>After some more time back and forth, I eventually got the script to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>fill in dummy information on each page</li>
        <li>both randomly select options or specific options depending on the page</li>
        <li>download screenshots on each page and saved them to a folder</li>
        <li>create relevant file names for each image</li>
        <li>combine all images into a user journey map once the script ended</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="picture">
          <figure>
            <img src="../../../images/article_chatgpt/entering_information.png" alt="A screenshot of a check your answers page that is generated after getting the code to enter dummy information." width="100%">
            <figcaption>A screenshot of a check your answers page that is generated after getting the code to enter dummy information.</figcaption>
          </figure>
      </div>
      <p>It’s still a work in progress of trying to speed up the process of creating user journey maps, but it certainly helped me learn and create something I wouldn’t have been able to before. I’m considering turning this into its own blog when it’s in a good place.</p>
      <div class="picture">
        <figure>
          <img src="../../../images/article_chatgpt/complete_user_journey.png" alt="a generated image containing all the screenshots to create a simple user journey map." width="100%">
          <figcaption>a generated image containing all the screenshots to create a simple user journey map.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Wrapping up</h3>
      <h4>How often I use it</h4>
      <p>I've noticed there’s been no consistency of when I use it, it could be days before I try using it, and then some days I might use it three or four times. It’s certainly not a constant part of my ways of working yet, but I’m sure it will be soon.</p>
      <p>I’m keen to see how others have been using it so feel free to reach out if you found this interesting –yes, I did use ChatGPT to help me write this.</p>
